# User Manual
This document is aimed at new users who want learn or get an overview of the BOLD platform features.

## Definitions
### Dataset
A BOLD dataset represents an (imported) RDF dataset. 

The dataset consists of a SPARQL endpoint and a search index.
Both can point to either a local of a remote resource.

The datasets can be shared between users and reports.

### Report
A BOLD report represents a collection of cells that contain SPARQL queries and widgets.
A report also persists all the query and widget results so that they can be reviewed later.

#### Report Cell
A report cell contains either SPARQL queries or a configurable widget which generates queries for the database.

### Task
A BOLD task represents a collection of work that can be scheduled and assigned to a worker.
Tasks are meant to be used for long-running tasks and run in parallel to avoid blocking the main server.
